- We said nights at around 12 midnight. Falling asleep was a different story as we both stayed awake for, at least, 2 hours more.
- Understandably, he is not unhappy of the situation, posting about it online. I would have felt the same giving the situation. No amount of hospitality from my side could replace what he had lost. But I am NOT going to give up.
