- We said nights at around 12 midnight. Falling asleep was a different story as we both stayed awake for, at least, 2 hours more.
- Understandably, he is unhappy with the situation, posting about it online. I would have felt the same giving the situation. No amount of hospitality from my side could replace what he had lost. But I am NOT going to give up doing my best.
-
- He woke up late for work. I was on and off since 6am. I plan to offer that I wake him up if this continues. Hopefully he'll accept.
-
- But I need to be consistent with my sleep schedule. That means no bullshit staying late, and most definitely I should cut my bad habits. I seriously must better myself first before I am able to offer impactful support. At least that's my opinion.
-
- It seems the "split-up" proceedings were halted for yesterday. We had a talk about it. Both parties are trying to paint themselves as the victim, which is to be expected.
-
- I tried to talk him into salvaging the situation. The more information gets disclosed the less I think the situation is salvageable. detailed stories will not be mentioned in this journal.
-
- My issue is that the same sources who notified me regarding my friends issues are the ones who stated my friend, against his best judgement, may lie in some case. The mental health issue isn't helping me blinding trusting anything, as I would much rather do.
