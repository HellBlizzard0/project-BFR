- Understandably, he is unhappy with the situation, posting about it online. I would have felt the same giving the situation. No amount of hospitality from my side could replace what he had lost. But I am NOT going to give up doing my best.

- He woke up late for work. I was on and off since 6am. I plan to offer that I wake him up if this continues. Hopefully he'll accept.
