	- Her brother came and calm things down a bit. My friend, I believe told him regarding his issues with her. The brother talked to her and tried to settle things down.

	- He left social media apps, hopefully for good.
	- She has trust issues, regularly asking about is whereabouts.

- He doesn't want to show to her his lack of interest though.
	- I advised him to keep these thoughts outside of his mind. They both have the same goals, which is the daughter.
	- TODO Overtime, I am going to attempt to persuade him to give her another chance.

- He intends to find hobbies/activities that are keeps him away from her. Ideas that were mentioned:
	- Enclosed communities who gather up and chat/do group activities. This one would be a red flag for the wife as such communities consist of both men and women.
	- Gym. I proposed this idea. This will make sure he has an outlet to expend his energy. Also it should help fix his sleep schedule. We shall go together, choosing a branch that is close to his home. This will be hell for me admittedly, but I hope it will help improve his life.
