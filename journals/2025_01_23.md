We have managed to complete our first week at the gym! 

All days were full body.
He managed to fit enough time through his highly busy schedule. I am very proud of that.

It seems my motivation is working. I just need to keep it up and, hopefully, we will end up with the best results.

We're going to specialize our training for the next week onwards. I have to maintain my position that the two main (Whatever) that needs to be in our minds during exercise is:
- **Entertainment**. Without entertainment, we might as well do something else besides the gym
- **Safety**. I do NOT want to repeat the same mistakes from last year. I do NOT want him to commit the same mistakes I did last year.
