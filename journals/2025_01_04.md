# Project BFR
- BFR = Best Friend Recovery
-
- The purpose of this journal is to document important info so my shitty brain is allowed to forget as it always does.
- This journal is intended to be written and seen by me (Ahmad) and only me.
- If for whatever reason you find this, know that I had the best intentions in mind. And I will never give up on supporting you in whatever it is that you need. You are my best friend after all. Admittedly, you have told me things that got me surprised. But I saw that as an opportunity to provide my time and energy to help. And I am committed to be by your side through thick and thin.
-
- To maintain anonymity, I will NOT refer to you by name in the entirety of this journal. This will be done in case a 3rd party has access to these documents.

- Today's entry is a short one.
- I'm blessed to have him join me in my apartment. I noticed that he took a while to appear as he went back home to grab the rest of his luggage. It is almost 11pm now when heh state that he'll be there at 10pm. I am waiting for him so we could have our dinner and settle for the night.
