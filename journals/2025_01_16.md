- Today he asked me to fake a WhatsApp conversation to convince his wife to hangout alone. Honestly I was a little afraid he might hurt himself somehow. I also, did not appreciate lying to his wife since I respect her. He told me he went to a tea shop.
  
  I do hope he was actually alone, and this was beneficial as he stated. He stated that he's used to being alone since his scholarship years. Although I find it odd that he just now realized that he needed some space.
  
  He stayed there for roughly two hours, from 10:25-12:13.

### Theory
  I asked him to bring me a cup from that place, at 11:13, to which he replied immediately. exactly one hour later he said that he's coming to my place. He brought me a cup of tea from gas station next to my block. I thought it was odd that he failed to bring me one from the same tea place he was at. Perhaps he left that place early? Or maybe I am just overthinking as usual.
  

He came to my place and I set up his new vape for him and gave him 2 0NIC juices. I do hope he won't ignore them and go for nicotine juices. 
  Honestly, I find the flavors to be quite disgusting, hopefully he doesn't agree with me.
