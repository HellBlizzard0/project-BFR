- My anxiety was a bit high since he did not respond to our chat on snapchat. I thought something was up. My mind is too occupied with the SMS, since it is the only form of messaging communication that does not require access to his phone. You could just take out the SIM card and use it anywhere else.

- I could not handle the wait any longer. So I called him at 4pm, the phone rang for a bit but he eventually answered. Sounded like he was asleep and I woke him up. I played it cool, pretending like I am asking if he's coming to my place so I would grab dinner for him.
- From his response, it seems like things are turning for the best. Maybe their marriage can be salvaged as I predicted. Or maybe I am just getting the wrong message. I hope not. I'll be on standby for any chance to meet with him.
