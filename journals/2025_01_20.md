Today we went to the gym for the first time together. We were just getting started to our exercise was easy. We'll be doing full body for a whole week before we start to specialize.

He had a muscle issue with his lower chest muscle. A strain-like pain. To endure the pain he dropped to his knees for 5-10 mins before he felt we could continue. All upper body exercises were cancelled due to this pain, the exception being the one chest press device which we played before the strain occurred. I have to remind him not to put too much pressure, especially now that we're just starting.

- [ ] I got to say, the gym do not have all the required machines to easily transition my exercise plan to. So I have to get creative. I will have to figure it out by the next week. ⏫ 📅 2025-01-25
