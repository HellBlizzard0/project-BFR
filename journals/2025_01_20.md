Today's gym visit was a bit better. We learned more about the machines available. Luckily his chest did not hurt like yesterday [[2025_01_19]], hopefully for good. 

I suspect that his yesterday's chest workout was wrong. So that might have caused the issue. Although he mentioned that it may occur during rest times. For now, we'll continue doing chest workout last after everything related to the upper body. 

He mentioned that the wife is visiting the same therapy for her issues. I hope this might improve their relationship. Nothing I can do on this matter.
