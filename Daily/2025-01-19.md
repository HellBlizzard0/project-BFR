## License Type (License_CS)
[[BMQ Renew Backlog]]
TP-618

~~Added new LicenseType = LicenseType.BMQLicenseRenewal~~
==Nothing was added because I was assigned to do Taskmanagement for new BMQ License==
I am still not sure what to add in the following columns:
	* Code
		* Code has NO usage in the whole system
	* DelegatePermissionId
Mentioned Columns are kept empty for now.
