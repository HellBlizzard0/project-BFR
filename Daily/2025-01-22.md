An idea which was scrapped [[Experiment Showing All Data as List of fields]]


3rd wasted day with no progress on [[Progress/New BMQ License TaskManagement|New BMQ License TaskManagement]]
All thanks to the endless research of the best method to store and retrieve Met/NotMet fields.


For tomorrow, create a sample for the workplan using the same method used in the Test screen.
Try to implement the idea you have proposed on regarding different layouts (inspired by Youtube).
