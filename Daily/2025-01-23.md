## Solution of TM Response Problem
#Taskmanagement #Employee 
One entity that houses all Responses named TaskRecordResponse.

| Column      | Id  | Response   | LicenseRequestId | ProcessTypeId | RowId                               | Label                  |
| ----------- | --- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Description |     | Met/NotMet |                  |               | Reference Id for Dynamic size lists | The name of the field. |
|             |     |            |                  |               |                                     |                        |

We then fetch the list of responses based on the LicenseRequestId and ProcessTpeId.
The final field search is done using the Label, i.e searching using the string name of the field.

This entity is being store in ==TaskManagement_CS== and being fetched from ==TaskManagement_BL==. Note that TaskManagement_BL will return the data in a general structure named ==TaskResponse==. 


- [ ] I should start converting my Structure on BQM_License_BL to accommodate the Responses coming from the TaskResponse structure as I fetch my responses. The name of the Fetch action should be GetTasksRecordResponse in TaskManagement_BL. ➕ 2025-01-23 📅 2025-01-26 ⏫
